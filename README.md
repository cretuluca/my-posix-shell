# Custom Shell Implementation

This project is a custom shell implementation in C, which provides a simplistic command line interface. It provides both built-in commands and system utility commands. The inspiration for this project arose from my interest in the Linux Operating System and, therefore, the Unix command line.

## Building the Project
To build the project, run the `build.sh` script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

## Usage
```bash
./my_shell
```

## Functionalities
- Built-in commands:
  - `exit`: Exit the shell
  - `echo`: Print text to the console
  - `type`: Display information about command type
  - `pwd`: Print working directory
  - `cd`: Change directory
  - `history`: Display command history
- Execution of system utilities (ls, grep, kill,..)
- Command history management
